<h3 align="center">DDE COM Client v1.1</h3>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
This is a COM component to allow scripting of DDE Servers. It is an Automation
Server (i.e. programmable via <code>IDispatch</code>) that houses a number
of COM classes. The first is a <i>DDE Client</i>, which is a Singleton style
object that can be used to make ad-hoc DDE queries and querying for running DDE
servers. The second is for a specific <i>DDE Conversation</i> and can be used
as an optimisation when you need to query many values from the same DDE service
and topic.
</p>
<p>
At present it only supports the requesting of data in <code>CF_TEXT</code> format, which is
then converted to UNICODE to pass back over the COM interface. Most of the DDE
servers I have dealt with were ANSI based and given the nature of scripting I
felt this was probably a good first order approximation. If there is a need to
allow access in other formats (e.g. <code>CF_UNICODETEXT</code>, <code>CF_DIF</code>,
etc) I will add them to the API as and when the need arises.
</p>
<p>
It supports the main synchronous transaction types, i.e. reading
(<code>XTYP_REQUEST</code>), writing (<code>XTYP_POKE</code>) and executing
(<code>XTYP_EXECUTE</code>). The main feature of DDE that this component is missing
is the asynchronous updating of values via advise loops (a.k.a. DDE Links).
These have not been implemented as I didn't know if it was possible to handle
COM events from scripting languages such as VBScript, which is its intended
audience.
</p>
<p>
The component is implemented in C++ using COM <i>dual</i> interfaces, so also
supports early binding. However, if you're using C++ you might be better off
using my underlying <a href="http://www.chrisoldwood.com/win32.htm#ncl">NCL library/DDE classes</a>
directly.

<h4>The DDE Client Class</h4>

<p>
The DDE Client class is essentially a Singleton object that provides
simple access to DDE servers. If all you need to do is query for a few values
from a DDE source or two you can do it with repeated calls to
<code>RequestTextItem()</code>. It also provides access to the Wildcard style request
(<code>XTYP_WILDCONNECT</code>) so that you can query for running servers and their topics.
</p> 

<h5>Property: long DefaultTimeout</h5>
<p>
This property controls the default timeout (in milliseconds) used for DDE
transactions that occur on <i>new</i> conversations after it has been changed.
The default timeout is set to 30 secs (i.e 30,000 ms).
</p>

<h5>string[] RunningServers()</h5>
<p>
Finds out which DDE servers are currently running and returns a collection of
the server names. The collection is an array of strings.
</p>

<h5>string[] GetServerTopics(string service)</h5>
<p>
Finds out what topics are supported by a running DDE server. The return value
is an array of strings which are the topic names.
</p>

<h5>IDDEConversation OpenConversation(string service, string topic)</h5>
<p>
Open a DDE conversation for a specific Server and Topic.<br/>
<br/>
See the <a href="#DDEConversation">DDE Conversation</a> class for other ways to
open a conversation.
</p>

<h5>IDDEConversations Conversations()</h5>
<p>
Get the collection of open DDE conversations. This collection is enumerable
using the "<code>for each</code>" idiom or can be indexed directly using the <code>Item()</code>
method.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Note: The <code>Item()</code> method follows the VBScript and WMI convention of being
0-based</i>.
</p>

<h5>string RequestTextItem(string service, string topic, string item)</h5>
<p>
Request the current value for a single item from a named service and topic. The
item is requested in <code>CF_TEXT</code> (i.e. ANSI) format and then converted
to UNICODE to pass back via COM as a string.
</p>

<h5>void PokeTextItem(string service, string topic, string item, string value)</h5>
<p>
Set the value of a single item for a named service and topic. The item will be
passed in <code>CF_TEXT</code> (i.e. ANSI) format, even though it's being passed
to the COM server via a Unicode string.
</p>

<h5>void ExecuteTextCommand(string service, string topic, string command)</h5>
<p>
Send a command string to the DDE server to be executed. The string will be 
passed in <code>CF_TEXT</code> (i.e. ANSI) format, even though it's being passed
to the COM server via a Unicode string.<br>
<br/>
<i>Note: The XTYP_EXECUTE transaction type is an oddity because the format type
is not passed to the DDE server in the request unike with the other
transactions.</i>
</p>

<h4>The DDE Conversation Class</h4>

<p>
The DDE Conversation class is really an optimisation (and an excuse for me to
implement a COM collection) that avoids the overhead of creating a conversation
every time an item is requested. If you have many values to request from a
single <code>Service|Topic</code> pair you can open an explicit conversation either from
the DDE Clients' <code>OpenConversation()</code> method, or use the "<code>ddelink:</code>" moniker
namespace and then use that to request the items.
</p> 

<h5>Property: string Service</h5>
<p>
This property is the DDE service name. It can be read at any time, but only
modified when the conversation is not open.
</p>

<h5>Property: string Topic</h5>
<p>
This property is the DDE topic name. It can be read at any time, but only
modified when the conversation is not open.
</p>

<h5>Property: long Timeout</h5>
<p>
This property controls the timeout (in milliseconds) used for the DDE
transactions that occur the conversation.
</p>

<h5>void Open()</h5>
<p>
Opens the conversation specified by the Service and Topic properties. If the
conversation is already open, an error is returned.<br/>
<br/>
This method allows a DDE conversation to be opened by creating an explicit
DDE Conversation object, setting the Service and Topic names and then calling
the <code>Open()</code> method.
</p>

<h5>bool IsOpen()</h5>
<p>
Checks if the conversation is currently open. Returns <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.
</p>

<h5>void Close()</h5>
<p>
Closes the DDE conversation. If the conversation is not open then the operation
has no effect.
</p>

<h5>string RequestTextItem(string item)</h5>
<p>
Request the current value for a single item. The item is requested in
<code>CF_TEXT</code> (i.e. ANSI) format and then converted to UNICODE to pass
back via COM as a string.
</p>

<h5>void PokeTextItem(string item, string value)</h5>
<p>
Set the value of a single item. The item will be passed in <code>CF_TEXT</code>
(i.e. ANSI) format, even though it's being passed to the COM server via a
Unicode string.
</p>

<h5>void ExecuteTextCommand(string command)</h5>
<p>
Send a command string to the DDE server to be executed. The string will be 
passed in <code>CF_TEXT</code> (i.e. ANSI) format, even though it's being passed
to the COM server via a Unicode string.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Note: The XTYP_EXECUTE transaction type is an oddity because the format type
is not passed to the DDE server in the request unike with the other
transactions.</i>
</p>

<h4>The DDE Conversation Moniker Namespace</h4>

<p>
WMI uses a moniker namespace of "winmgmts" to support simpler creation of WMI
queries by encoding the query as a moniker item, which in VBScript you pass
to <code>GetObject()</code>. You can achieve a similar effect with DDE Conversations by
using the "ddelink" namespace. The full moniker consists of the "ddelink:"
prefix, a "//" separator and the moniker item is the Service and Topic name
in DDE Link format, e.g.
</p><p>
ddelink://<b>SERVICE</b>|<b>TOPIC</b>
</p><p>
This helpfully gives the link a URL like syntax, and when support for true
links are added the syntax can be updated to allow a "!Item" style suffix.
</p>

<a name="Errors"></a>
<h4>Error Handling</h4>

<p>
All the COM objects support <code>IErrorInfo</code>, so you will receive
textual error messages along with the result code. If the underlying error
comes from DDE itself, then the symbolic name for the error code will be
included (e.g. <code>DMLERR_BUSY</code>) which you can look up in the DDE SDK.
</p>

<a name="Examples"></a>
<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>
The following set of examples should cover the most common scenarios. They are
written in VBScript as scripting was the reason I created the component. The
initial example shows how to create the DDE Client, which is then assumed in
the subsequent code snippets.
</p> 

<h5>Creating the DDE Client</h5>
<pre>
Dim oDDEClient
Set oDDEClient = CreateObject("DDECOMClient.DDEClient")
</pre>

<h5>Listing the Running Servers and Topics</h5>
<pre>
Dim astrServers, astrTopics
Dim i, j

astrServers = oDDEClient.RunningServers()

For i = LBound(astrServers) To UBound(astrServers)

    WScript.Echo "Server: " & astrServers(i)

    astrTopics = oDDEClient.GetServerTopics(astrServers(i))

    For j = LBound(astrTopics) To UBound(astrTopics)

        WScript.Echo "    Topic: " & astrTopics(j)

    Next

Next
</pre>

<h5>Requesting a Single Item</h5>
<pre>
Dim strValue
strValue = oDDEClient.RequestTextItem("PROGMAN", "PROGMAN", "Accessories")
</pre>

<h5>Opening a Conversation</h5>
<pre>
Dim oDDEConv
Set oDDEConv = oDDEClient.OpenConversation("PROGMAN", "PROGMAN")
</pre>
<p><i>or</i></p>
<pre>
Dim oDDEConv
Set oDDEConv = GetObject("ddelink://PROGMAN|PROGMAN")
</pre>
<p><i>or</i></p>
<pre>
Dim oDDEConv
Set oDDEConv = CreateObject("DDECOMClient.DDEConversation")

With oDDEConv
    .Service = "PROGMAN"
    .Topic   = "PROGMAN"
End With

oDDEConv.Open()
</pre>

<h5>Requesting Items From One Conversation</h5>
<pre>
Dim oDDEConv
Set oDDEConv = GetObject("ddelink://PROGMAN|PROGMAN")

Dim strValue1, strValue2, strValue3
strValue1 = oDDEConv.RequestTextItem("Accessories")
strValue2 = oDDEConv.RequestTextItem("Games")
strValue3 = oDDEConv.RequestTextItem("Startup")
</pre>

<h5>Setting the Value For an Item On a Conversation</h5>
<pre>
Dim oDDEConv
Set oDDEConv = GetObject("ddelink://Excel|[Book1]Sheet1")

oDDEConv.PokeTextItem "R1C1", "a value"
</pre>

<h5>Sending a Command to a Running DDE Server</h5>
<pre>
Dim oDDEClient
Set oDDEClient = CreateObject("DDECOMClient.DDEClient")

oDDEClient.ExecuteTextCommand "Excel", "[Book1]Sheet1", "[App.Maximize()]"
</pre>
